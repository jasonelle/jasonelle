    A file in ``partial_source_files`` DID produce output this run, but only a

    detect_incremental would see it "done" and never re-dispatch it, leaving the
    incomplete node set live forever on the warm-incremental path. Same #933
    mechanism: leave it unstamped and it is re-queued next run.

    Both sides of the membership test are resolved against the scan ``root``
    before comparing (#1897): node/edge/hyperedge ``source_file`` values are
    root-relative on a fresh extraction while ``files_by_type`` entries are
    absolute (from detect()), so a raw string comparison never matched and
    every freshly-extracted semantic doc was dropped from the manifest.
    Mirrors the #1890 path normalization in graphify.llm.

    Hyperedges are counted as output (#1920): a chunk whose only result for a
    document is a hyperedge (3+ nodes sharing a concept) is valid output that
    the semantic cache persists per-``source_file`` — omitting it here left the
    doc unstamped, so detect_incremental re-queued it on every run. The stamping
    condition mirrors the cache-write keying (a hyperedge carries its own
    ``source_file``); do not derive it from member nodes.

    """Source files graph.json still references but the current scan no longer
    contains (#1909).

    Incremental extract's prune set was historically derived from the manifest
    alone (``manifest - corpus``), so a file that became EXCLUDED
    (.graphifyignore/.gitignore/--exclude changed) without being listed in the
    manifest kept its stale nodes in graph.json forever. Derive prune
    candidates from the graph's own node ``source_file``s instead: anything
    the graph references that the post-exclude detect corpus no longer
    contains is stale, whether the file was deleted or newly excluded.

    Only IN-ROOT paths are candidates: out-of-root/absolute entries
    (--include sources, symlinked external corpora) are never walked by
    detect, so their absence from the corpus is not staleness evidence.
    Relative entries are re-anchored against both the scan root and the
    graph's own output root; only anchors that land inside the scan root
    count. Since #1941 extracts always store source_file relative to the SCAN
    root, so the scan-root anchor is the live one; the out-root anchor stays
    for graphs written by <=0.9.16, which stored them relative to the OUT root
    (e.g. ``../project/x.py``, #555/#1899).
    ``seen_files`` must be the FULL detect output including unclassified
    files, so nodes from walked-but-unsupported sources (e.g. introspected
    Cargo.toml manifests) are not misread as stale.

    Paths are compared NFC-normalized on both sides: macOS reports NFD
    filenames while graph ``source_file`` entries are typically NFC, and a
    raw-string membership test misread every accented live file as stale
    (#2210; same class as the manifest-layer #2221/#2224).

    Fail-closed liveness guard (#2210, mirrors watch.py's excluded-vs-deleted
    distinction): a source missing from the scan corpus is only pruned when
    the file is gone from disk, or when its exclusion is PROVABLE from the
    same scan that produced ``seen_files`` — ``detection``'s ``ignored`` /
    ``pruned_noise_dirs`` / ``skipped_sensitive`` output, or detect's
    sensitivity predicate. An alive file that merely failed the membership
    test (path-spelling drift the normalization didn't cover, walk errors,
    …) is KEPT and reported, never mass-evicted.

    The hook's out-of-project guard needs "is this path resolved against cwd?",
    and ``Path.is_absolute()`` is the wrong question for it on Windows. A
    driveless rooted path like ``/tmp/x.py`` — the form POSIX-shaped hosts, WSL
    and Git Bash send — is NOT absolute there (no drive letter), but it is not
    cwd-relative either: Windows anchors it at the current DRIVE root, so
    ``Path("/somewhere/else/x.py").resolve()`` is ``C:\somewhere\else\x.py``,
    which is outside the project unless the project sits at ``C:\``. Reading it
    as cwd-relative made the guard declare it in-project and emit the read nudge
    (and, in strict mode, the once-per-session deny) for files the graph has
    nothing to say about.

    ``C:x.py`` is the same trap from the other side: drive-relative, anchored at
    that drive's current directory rather than cwd.

    So the test is "no root and no drive", not "not absolute". These stay the
    host's own rules — the path is about to be resolved against this filesystem,
    so ``paths.is_absolute_any_platform`` (for stored, portable paths) is
    deliberately not used. On POSIX ``root`` is set exactly when the path is
    absolute and ``drive`` is always empty, so this is unchanged there.
