    The semantic cache is content-hash-keyed (``{file_hash}.json`` under
    ``cache/semantic/``) and deliberately UNVERSIONED — entries are produced by
    the LLM from file contents, so invalidating them on every release would
    re-bill extraction. Because it is unversioned it is also never swept by the
    AST version-cleanup, so every content change or file deletion leaves a
    permanent orphan entry that accumulates unbounded.

    This sweeps ``cache/semantic/*.json`` AND ``cache/semantic-deep/*.json``
    (the ``--mode deep`` namespace, #1894) and deletes any entry whose stem
    (the content hash) is not in ``live_hashes`` — the hashes of the current
    live document set. Both namespaces are pruned against the SAME live set:
    liveness is content-based and mode-independent, so a hash that is live for
    one namespace is live for both. Skipping the deep namespace would re-grow
    the unbounded-orphan problem this function fixed (#1527). ``*.tmp``
    atomic-write temporaries are skipped, and only these directories are
    touched (never ``cache/ast/**`` or anything else). The unversioned design
    is preserved: we prune by liveness, not by version.

    The sweep recurses into the per-prompt-fingerprint subdirs (#1939) for the
    same reason it covers the deep namespace: a glob that stopped at the top
    level would leave every fingerprinted entry permanently unprunable. Entries
    under a fingerprint other than the current one are pruned by liveness only,
    never swept wholesale the way :func:`_cleanup_stale_ast_entries` sweeps old
    AST versions — two hosts with different prompts (verbose vs compact
    extraction-spec) can share one graphify-out/, and a wholesale sweep would
    have each run delete the other's entries and re-bill extraction on every
    alternation. Liveness keeps the total bounded by live docs × prompts seen.

    Best-effort, mirroring :func:`_cleanup_stale_ast_entries`: each unlink is
    wrapped in ``try/except OSError`` and a failure is ignored. The worst-case
    failure mode is benign — a surviving orphan costs only one re-extraction of
    one doc on a future run, never incorrect output.

    ``mode`` selects the cache namespace, mirroring
    :func:`check_semantic_cache`: ``None`` (the default) writes
    ``cache/semantic/`` — byte-identical to the historical behavior for
    existing callers that omit it — while a non-None mode (e.g. ``"deep"``)
    writes ``cache/semantic-{mode}/`` so richer deep-mode results never
    overwrite standard-mode entries and vice versa (#1894).

    When ``merge_existing`` is True, any already-cached entry for a file is
    unioned with the new results before saving instead of being overwritten.
    This lets callers checkpoint incrementally (e.g. once per chunk) without
    dropping a prior slice of a large file that was split across chunks.

    When ``allowed_source_files`` is provided, only those files may be used as
    cache-write keys. Semantic nodes can legitimately mention another corpus
    file, but a model must not be able to replace that file's complete cache
    entry unless the file was part of the current extraction batch (#1757).

    When ``partial_source_files`` is provided, entries for those files are
    stamped ``partial: True`` — the extraction was truncated, so the entry is
    incomplete and :func:`load_cached` must treat it as a miss. Partial-ness is
    ALSO detected intrinsically from a ``_partial`` marker on any grouped item,
    so the flag survives even when a caller (e.g. cli.py's final save) does not
    pass ``partial_source_files``.

    ``prompt`` is the extraction prompt that produced these results — text, or
    a Path to the prompt file. It stamps entries into the p{fingerprint}/
    namespace so a later run under a different prompt re-extracts rather than
    replaying them (#1939). Pass the same prompt here as to
    :func:`check_semantic_cache`, or the write lands in a namespace the next
    read won't consult.

    and :func:`save_cached` already expose (#1774). When given, cache files land
    under ``cache_root`` while ``source_file`` paths are still resolved and
    relativized against ``root``. When omitted, ``root`` is used for both
    purposes (unchanged behaviour for existing callers). This fixes checkpoints
    and the final save going to the corpus tree instead of ``--out`` (#1990,
