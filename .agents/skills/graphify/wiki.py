    was written under. When the label has an article, emit a standard
    ``[label](slug.md)`` link whose target is the on-disk name VERBATIM.

    The target is deliberately not percent-encoded (#2597). ``quote()`` turned
    ``_make_id().md`` into ``_make_id%28%29.md`` while the file stayed raw, so
    the link pointed at a path that does not exist. Renderers hid it by
    decoding before resolving, but the wiki's whole purpose is to be
    agent-crawlable, and an agent that reads the target off disk verbatim got a
    FileNotFoundError. ``_safe_filename`` now keeps the slug free of everything
    that would need encoding, so raw emission and the filename are the same
    string by construction — one source of truth instead of two spellings that
    happened to agree only for URL-safe labels.

    The old ``[[label]]`` form only resolved inside Obsidian, because the
    on-disk filename differs from the label — _safe_filename turns spaces into
    underscores and substitutes reserved characters — so e.g.
    ``[[Domain Data Models]]`` pointed at a non-existent
    ``Domain Data Models.md`` everywhere else.

    Labels with no article — most node-level links, since only communities and
    god nodes get article files — render as plain text instead of a dead link
