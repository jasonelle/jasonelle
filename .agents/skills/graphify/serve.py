    The combined ranking is byte-identical to what `_score_nodes` produced
    before the refactor; `_score_nodes` is now a thin wrapper that asks for
    `collect_per_term_seeds=False` and returns only `.ranked`.

    When `collect_per_term_seeds=True`, the per-token singleton winner is
    computed alongside the combined score in the *same* per-node visit (it
    reuses the same `norm_label` / `label_tokens` / `source` already evaluated
    for the combined tier), so `_query_graph_text` can feed `best_seed_by_term`
    straight into `_pick_seeds` and skip the T additional whole-graph rescoring
    passes the old per-token `_score_nodes([token])` loop ran.

    Singleton-winner semantics match the legacy per-token path exactly. The
    score itself mirrors `_score_nodes([token])` with `n_terms == 1` (so the
    coverage term is 1 and the per-token tier is unscaled) plus the broader
    joined-singlet tier (which also checks `label_tokens` and `nid_lower`).
    Tie-break order is (1) highest singleton score, (2) highest graph degree,
    (3) shortest displayed label, (4) lexicographically smallest node id —
    exactly what `max(tied, key=degree)` over a sort by `(-score, label_len,
    nid)` produced in the legacy `_pick_seeds` per-token loop. The combined
    trigram candidate set (needles `norm_terms + [joined]`) is a superset of
    each per-token `[t]` candidate set, so iterating combined candidates
    discovers every non-zero singleton-score node for every term.

    error nodes score 1.0, only FooBarService is seeded — the score gap is 99.9%
    which is well above the 20% threshold that would allow additional seeds.

    That same gap_ratio cutoff has a failure mode on multi-term natural-language
    queries: if one term happens to hit an EXACT label match on a node that is
    otherwise unrelated to the query's intent (e.g. a common word that is also
    used as an unrelated identifier or field name elsewhere in the corpus), it
    can outscore every SUBSTRING match on the query's other, actually-relevant
    terms by ~1000x (see `_EXACT_MATCH_BONUS` vs. `_SUBSTRING_MATCH_BONUS`).
    The 20%-gap cutoff then silently discards all of those substring-tier
    seeds, so the BFS traversal only ever explores the neighborhood of the one
    unrelated exact match — see #1445.

    When `G` and `best_seed_by_term` are supplied, this guarantees at least one

    traversal that produced `scored`) so this function no longer rescores the
    graph per term — see #1445 and the `_score_query` docstring.

    Coverage scaling in _score_nodes (#1602) now dampens a lone collision's
    exact tier on multi-term queries, which brings label-matching relevant
    nodes back inside the gap window; this per-term guarantee remains
    load-bearing for relevant nodes matched only via substrings, whose flat

    Self-loops are skipped. A recursive function legitimately carries one, but
    neither traversal has ever recorded one (`n` is always already visited when
    its own self-loop is examined), and surfacing them is a separate output
    change from the missing edges reported here.

    Dedup keys on the ordered pair for directed graphs and the unordered pair
    otherwise: on a DiGraph `u->v` and `v->u` are genuinely distinct edges
    (mutual recursion, circular imports), and collapsing them would drop a real
    one. On a multigraph parallel edges collapse to one entry, matching the
    renderer, which already shows only the first (`_subgraph_to_text`).

    Traversal edges keep their discovery order; completions are appended after.
